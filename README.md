# Welcome!

With over 10 years of experience as an accomplished computational astrophysicist, I published over 50 [research articles](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1274022?ui-citation-summary=true) in high-profile international journals, and gave over 80 talks at international conferences in 15 countries.

I am now interested in utilizing my expertise in big data science to solve business and industry problems. 

Here you can find a collection of repositories with projects on different topics, which I found interesting to dig into at the time! Unfortunately, many codes used for my past astrophysics research could not be made public, but feel free to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-barreira-367b68136/), if you want to learn more.
