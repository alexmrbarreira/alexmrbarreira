# Welcome!

With over 10 years of experience as an accomplished computational astrophysicist, I am now interested in utilizing my expertise in big data science to solve business and industry problems. 

I published over 50 [research articles](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1274022?ui-citation-summary=true) in high-profile international journals, and gave over 80 talks at international conferences in 15 countries.
